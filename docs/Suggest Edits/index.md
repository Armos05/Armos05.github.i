# How to edit this Webpage.

- Go to the repository ([here](https://github.com/Armos05/Armos05.github.io)).
- All the changes in the contents can be done by accessing the ``docs`` folder.
_Note: To perform any changes you need to have a github account and become a contributor to this repo before._

## Add a new section:
- Click on ``Add file``, then go to ``Create new File``.
- Create a new folder and name it as the section you want to add. After putting in the name, press ``\``. 
- This will make you folder now. After this name your markdown file anything you want with extension ``.md``.
- Then add the following in the begining of your markdown file:

- Update the Title name, as to which you want to view on the website, and append the nav_order as well. 
- `has_children = True` lets you attach subpages to your markdown.
_Note: If you want to move this section up, you have to change the order of the section, you are replacing it with._
- Now, start writing into your markdown file. You can find some basic syntacts of markdown ([here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)).
- Also, if you want to paste an image into your section, simply copy it to your local clipboard, and press ``Ctrl+V``, where you want to paste in your markdown file. Although this feature will not work if you will just copy it from google images (say), it should be copied from your local machine. Better idea would be to copy the image and just paste on something like powerpoint, Copy it again, and then you can just paste in the github markdown.


## Update a section.
- Go to the folder which you want to edit.
- Open the markdown file associated with it. 
- Edit it using your preference.
