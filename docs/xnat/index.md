# Welcome to XNAT


The following manual will guide you through [XNAT](../Glossary/glossary.md/#XNAT "Extensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit") setup steps, its use, and many other handy features. If you are more of a visual learner check out the [video guide](../Video_Guide/index.md)! If you encounter unfamiliar words - like [DICOM](../Glossary/glossary.md/#DICOM "Digital imaging and communications in medicine") - just click & you can find them in the [glossary](../Glossary/glossary.md). Alternatively, for selected words you can hover with your cursor over the word for a short definition.
