## Defacing Brain Scans.
Since, 2D MR scans can be reconstructed in 3D space. They are a threat to individual patient privacy as, the 3D reconstruction can be used for patient identification.
Therefore, we use algorithms, to deface the scans like ``pydeface``. 
Enable this in the _Project Settings_.
