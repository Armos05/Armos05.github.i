To create a new project navigate to the header and click *New > Project* and give it a title, running title, project ID. Here you can also provide further information, such as keyword. Lastly, define if the project is private, protected, or public and click *Create*.

Clicking the XNAT icon once more shows the newly created project in the project section.

By clicking *Prearchive* the data will temporarily be stored in a medium where you can control and change subject information before forwarding them to the archive. Now you can choose the data to be uploaded. Attention: Data has to be stored in a zip. file. Click *Begin Upload* to upload the imaging data to the prearchive.

Now you can proceed to the prearchive by navigating to *Upload > Prearchive*. The data of the newly added subject can now be reviewed and archived.

### 1.2. Troubleshooting

If you are sure that you sent the data to XNAT but you cannot find them either in the prearchive [(Fig.4)](#Manual/Login/Prearchive) nor in the archive (Fig.6) of the XNAT Intranet, try the following: 

- You might have forgotten to assign a proper project name to the subject. In this case, the data cannot be assigned. Ask your administrator to have a look in his prearchive to see if there are un-assigned data floating around
